    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // not copying, instead is referencing 'players' so any changes made to 'team' will be made to 'players' too

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // copies every element of 'team' into 'team2'

    // one day
    team2[2] = 'Bob';

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        name: 'cuck boy',
        age: 379
    };

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captien = person;
    captien.age = 29;
    console.log(person.age);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({},person,{age: 301297});
    console.log(cap2.age, captien.age);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
